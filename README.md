### Automated Physical Stock Integration for Semi-Finished Goods (SFG)

### Project Description:
This project automates the process of updating physical stock information for Semi-Finished Goods (SFG) in Excel files. It addresses the manual effort involved in integrating new batch information and updating physical stock values, saving significant time for employees and enhancing operational efficiency.

### Algorithm Overview:
1. **Read Data from Excel Files**: Read data from two Excel files, namely File 1 and File 4, containing SFG details and physical stock information, respectively.
2. **Merge Data**: Merge the data from both files into a single dataset, ensuring all columns are included.
3. **Add "Physical Stock" Column**: Create a new column titled "Physical Stock" in the merged dataset.
4. **Update Physical Stock Values**:
   - For each SFG material:
     - Check if physical stock data is available in File 4.
     - If available, set the "Physical Stock" for the corresponding row to the actual physical stock value.
     - If not available, set the "Physical Stock" to 0.
5. **Output Updated Dataset**: Save the updated dataset with integrated physical stock information.

### Key Benefits:
- **Time Savings**: Automating the physical stock integration process eliminates the need for manual data entry, saving approximately 8 hours of work per week (2 persons x 2 hours x 3 shifts).
- **Operational Efficiency**: Enhances operational efficiency by streamlining the process of updating SFG information, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving data accuracy.
- **Employee Satisfaction**: Frees up employees' time for more value-added tasks, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity.

### Conclusion:
"Automated Physical Stock Integration for SFG" revolutionizes the process of updating physical stock information for SFG materials, significantly reducing manual effort and improving operational efficiency. Its user-friendly interface and automated functionality make it an indispensable tool for streamlining inventory management processes.
